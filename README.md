# DistinguishingSentiments

NewsMood.py aims to analyze the overall Sentiment Analysis on tweet published by different Media Sources like: BBC, CBS, CNN FOX and NYTimes, using VADER ANALYZER.

Running the analysis on a sample of 100 tweets for each source we can assume three main consideration directly observable from the trand of the data obtained:

1) Taking consideration of the scatter plot, "Sentiment_Analysis_ScatterPlot.png", we can easly see that the distribution of the "dots" is preatty uniform between -1 and +1 (Compound score), but actually what is most resonable is the concentration of "dots" around 0 for each Media Source. That means that the biggest part of tweets for each Media Source reached 0 as Compound Score.

2) Looking at the Bar chart, "Overall_Sentiment_Analysis_BarChart.png", is preatty obvious that the worst Overall Compound Score has been reached by the NYTimes immediatly followed by CNN, instead the best one has been reached by CBS, and all the remain are positive rated. Summarizing, looking at the trend of the data during these day, I always have got the same results for what concerning NYtimes and CBS.

3) Taking 100 tweets as sample for the analysis the results should not be totally reliable. Is important to conduct the same analysis on a bigger sample to get consistent and reliable results.
